                        <p>WITH LOVE DARLING is wanting to create a new special piece of jewelery for COMIC RELIEF.</p>
                        <p>COMIC RELIEF is an organization with the mission to end child poverity by funding programs that keep children safe, healthy, and educated. Through the power of entertainment, they bring people together to laugh and have fun, all while raising life-changing cash for the children that need it the most. WITH LOVE DARLING wants to help make that goal a reality by helping produce a new piece of jewelery that represents the message of this campaign perfectly.</p>
                        <p><b>This is where YOU come in.</b></p>
                        <p>We want to challenge you, whether you're a closet creatvie or a budding designer or you just want to be a part of the Comic Relief movement, to design the perfect ORIGINAL charm for the charity, that can be attached to a necklace or bracelet.</p>
                        <p>The objective for this content is to engage and inspire a wider community around Comic Relief, and the message it brings. We think this piece should connect to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #1, NO POVERTY, whose values lineup with Comic Relief.</p>
                        <p>The deadline to submit your design is <b>{{ $contest->getSubmitDateText() }}</b>. The voters and the With Love Darling team will carefully choose the finalists, taking into account creativity, uniqueness, and how effective it is towards the message of No Poverty and Comic Relief. After we choose a shortlist of finalists, anyone can vote for their favourite design until <b>{{ $contest->getEndDateText() }}</b>. The winning artist will be rewarded with $1,000, a feature on the Comic Relief and With Love Darling websites, and commission for whatever sales are made from the designed piece.</p>
                        <p>Think about the story you want to tell with your design.<br />How can you inspire people to help make a difference?</p>
                        <p>We believe in you, and the art you create.</p>
