                                            <br />
                                            <p>COMIC RELIEF is an organization with the mission to end child poverity by funding programs that keep children safe, healthy, and educated. Through the power of entertainment, they bring people together to laugh and have fun, all while raising life-changing cash for the children that need it the most. WITH LOVE DARLING wants to help make that goal a reality by helping produce a new piece of jewelery that represents the message of this campaign perfectly.</p>
                                            <br />

After we choose a shortlist of finalists, anyone can vote for their favourite design until February 15, 2020.

                                                    <br /> Can I design the piece with a friend?
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Sure! You can design alone or as a team. If you're the lucky winners, you'll split the prize, the commissions and credits.</li>
